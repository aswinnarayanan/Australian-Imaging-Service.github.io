A descriptive name for the service. The organisation name, which must be an AAF subscriber, of the service. Indicate the service’s purpose - development/testing/production-ready. Your Keybase account id to share the credentials securely.  For 1. This is extremely important and based on two options in the openid-provider.properties file:\n siteUrl preEstablishedRedirUri  We will use this example below (this is the correct syntax):\n openid-provider.properties siteUrl=https://xnat.example.com  preEstablishedRedirUri=/openid-login  In this case, the answer to 1 should be https://xnat.example.com/openid-login Submitting https://xnat.example.com will lead to a non functional AAF setup.\nCan be anything – preferably descriptive. Exactly what it says. Mostly the university name depending on organisation This is important as it will dictate the AAF Servers your service will authenticate against.

You would receive this error message trying to access your own project!\nAIS Deployment team created a forked version of the plugin which fixes this issue. You can view it here:\nhttps://github.com/Australian-Imaging-Service/xnat-openid-auth-plugin\nTo deploy to XNAT, navigate to the XNAT home/ plugins folder on your XNAT Application Server – normally /data/xnat/home/plugins and then download.

This assumes you have a valid AAF organisation login.\nUsing AAF with the AIS Kubernetes Chart Deployment The AIS Charts Helm template has all you need to setup a completely functional XNAT implementation in minutes, part of this is AAF integration. Prerequisites: •\tA functional HTTPS URL with valid SSL certificate for your Kubernetes cluster. See the top of this document for details to provide to AAF.\n•\tA ClientId and Secret provided by AAF.\n•\tA Load Balancer or way to connect externally to your Kubernetes using the functional URL with SSL certificate.\nBefore you deploy the Helm template, clone it via git here:\ngit clone https://github.com/Australian-Imaging-Service/charts.git\nthen edit the following file:\ncharts/releases/xnat/charts/xnat-web/values.yaml\nAnd update the following entries underneath openid:\nNB\u003e These entries DO require being placed within “”  preEstablishedRedirUri:\"/openid-login\"siteUrl:\"\"#List of providers that appear on the login pageproviders:aaf:accessTokenUri:https://central.aaf.edu.au/providers/op/token#accessTokenUri: https://central.test.aaf.edu.au/providers/op/tokenuserAuthUri:https://central.aaf.edu.au/providers/op/authorize#userAuthUri: https://central.test.aaf.edu.au/providers/op/authorizeclientId:\"\"clientSecret:\"\"Comment out the Test or Production providers depending on which environment your XNAT will reside in.

The entries must match exactly AAF won’t work.\n  If you get a 400 error message when redirecting from XNAT to AAF like so:\nhttps://central.test.aaf.edu.au/providers/op/authorize?client_id=\u0026redirect_uri=https://xnat.example.com/openid-login\u0026response_type=code\u0026scope=openid%20profile%20email\u0026state=IcoFrh\nThe ClientId entry is wrong. This happened before when the properties file had ClientId like this:\nopenid.aaf.clientID rather than:\nopenid.aaf.clientId You can see client_id section is empty. This wrongly capitalised entry results in the clientId not be passed to the URL to redirect and a 400 error message.\n  Check the log files. The most useful log file for error messages is the Tomcat localhost logfile. On RHEL based systems, this can be found here (example logfile):\n/var/log/tomcat7/localhost.2021-08-08.log You can also check the XNAT logfiles, mostly here (depending on where XNAT Home is on your system):\n/data/xnat/home/logs   ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Applying for AAF Integration ClientId and Secret AAF have several …","ref":"/docs/charts/operations/aaf-integration/","tags":"","title":"Integrating AAF with AIS Kubernetes XNAT Deployment"},{"body":"Creating an Application Load Balancer to connect to the AIS Helm chart XNAT Implementation We will be following this AWS Guide:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html\nBefore we begin One thing that you need to know when we want to create new ALB from EKS is service spec type can only support LoadBalancer and NodePort. It won’t support ClusterIP.  The Charts Repo has the service defined as ClusterIP so some changes need to be made to make this work. We will get to that later after we have created the ALB and policies.\nIn this document we create a Cluster called xnat in ap-southeast-2.

Although you can specify ip or instance for the target-type, you need to specify ip or autoscaling won’t function correctly. This is because stickiness isn’t honoured for target-type instance so you have the known issue where XNAT database thinks you are logged in but instance / pod knows you are not and then it logs you out again.

Kubernetes has a built in module: Cert Manager, to deal with cross clouds / infrastructure.\nhttps://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/\nHowever, in this case, AWS has a built in Certificate Manager that creates and a renews SSL certificates for free so we will be using this technology.\nYou can read more about it here:\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/getting-started/#:~:text=To%20get%20started%20with%20ACM,certificate%20from%20your%20Private%20CA.\nThis assumes you have a valid certificate created through AWS Certificate Manager and you know the ARN.\nThese are additional annotations to add to values file and explanations above:\nListen on port 80 and 443:\nalb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports:'[{\"HTTP\": 80}, {\"HTTPS\":443}]'Specify the ARN of your SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (change for your actual ARN):\nalb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn:\"arn:aws:acm:XXXXXXX:certificate/XXXXXX\"Specify AWS SSL Policy:\nalb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-policy:\"ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-Ext-2018-06\"For more details see here of SSL policy options:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html\nFinally, for this to successfully work you need to change the host path to allow any path or the Tomcat URL will be sent to a 404 by the Load Balancer.

After some testing this is legacy and HPA is preferred and also built into the Helm chart so we won’t be utilising this technology.\n  Cluster-autoscaling\nCluster-autoscaling is where the Kubernetes cluster itself spins up or down new Nodes (think EC2 instances in this case) to handle capacity.\n  You can’t use HPA and VPA together so we will use HPA and Cluster-Autoscaling. Prerequisites  Running Kubernetes Cluster and XNAT Helm Chart AIS Deployment AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) as an Ingress Controller with some specific annotations Resources (requests and limits) need to specified in your values file Metrics Server Cluster-Autoscaler  \nYou can find more information on applying ALB implementation for the AIS Helm Chart deployment in the ALB-Ingress-Controller document in this repo, so will not be covering that here, save to say there are some specific annotations that are required for autoscaling to work effectively.\nSpecific annotations required:\nalb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-group-attributes:\"stickiness.enabled=true,stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds=1800,load_balancing.algorithm.type=least_outstanding_requests\"alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type:ipLet’s breakdown and explain the sections.\nChange the stickiness of the Load Balancer:\nIt is important to set a stickiness time on the load balancer. This forces you to the same pod all the time and retains your session information. Without stickiness, after logging in, the Database thinks you have logged but the Load Balancer can alternate which pod you go to. The session details are kept on each pod so the new pod thinks you aren’t logged in and keeps logging you out all the time. Setting stickiness time reasonably high – say 30 minutes, can get round this.\nstickiness.enabled=true,stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds=1800Change the Load Balancing Algorithm for best performance:\nload_balancing.algorithm.type=least_outstanding_requestsChange the Target type:\nNot sure why but if target-type is set to instance and not ip, it disregards the stickiness rules.\nalb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type:ip\nResources (requests and limits) need to specified in your values file In order for HPA and Cluster-autoscaling to work, you need to specify resources - requests and limits, in the AIS Helm chart values file, or it won’t know when to scale.\nThis makes sense because how can you know when you are running out of resources to start scaling up if you don’t know what your resources are to start with?\nIn your values file add the following lines below the xnat-web section (please adjust the CPU and memory to fit with your environment):\nresources:limits:cpu:1000mmemory:3000Mirequests:cpu:1000mmemory:3000MiYou can read more about what this means here:\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/\nFrom my research with HPA, I discovered a few important facts.\n Horizontal Pod Autoscaler doesn’t care about limits, it bases autoscaling on requests. Requests are meant to be the minimum needed to safely run a pod and limits are the maximum. However, this is completely irrelevant for HPA as it ignores the limits altogether so I specify the same resources for requests and limits. See this issue for more details:  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72811\nXNAT is extremely memory hungry, and any pod will use approximately 750MB of RAM without doing anything. This is important as when the requests are set below that, you will have a lot of pods scale up, then scale down and no consistency for the user experience. This will play havoc with user sessions and annoy everyone a lot. Applications - specifically XNAT Desktop can use a LOT of memory for large uploads (I have seen 12GB RAM used on an instance) so try and specify as much RAM as you can for the instances you have. In the example above I have specified 3000MB of RAM and 1 vCPU. The worker node instance has 4 vCPUs and 4GB. You would obviously use larger instances if you can. You will have to do some testing to work out the best Pod to Instance ratio for your environment.  \nMetrics Server Download the latest Kubernetes Metrics server yaml file. We will need to edit it before applying the configuration or HPA won’t be able to see what resources are being used and none of this will work.\nwget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml Add the following line:\n- --kubelet-insecure-tlsto here:\nspec:containers:- args:Completed section should look like this:\nspec:containers:- args:- --kubelet-insecure-tls- --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP- --cert-dir=/tmp- --secure-port=443- --kubelet-use-node-status-port- --metric-resolution=15sNow apply it to your Cluster:\nk -nkube-system apply -f components.yaml Congratulations - you now have an up and running Metrics server.\nYou can read more about Metrics Server here:\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server \nCluster-Autoscaler There are quite a lot of ways to use the Cluster-autoscaler - single zone node clusters deployed in single availability zones (no AZ redundancy), single zone node clusters deployed in multiple Availability zones or single Cluster-autoscalers that deploy in multiple Availability Zones. In this example we will be deploying the autoscaler in multiple Availability Zones (AZ’s).\nIn order to do this, a change needs to be made to the StorageClass configuration used.\nDelete whatever StorageClasses you have and then recreate them changing the VolumeBindingMode. At a minimum you will need to change the GP2 / EBS StorageClass VolumeBindingMode but if you are using a persistent volume for archive / prearchive, that will also need to be updated.\nChange this:\napiVersion:storage.k8s.io/v1kind:StorageClassmetadata:name:gp2annotations:storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class:\"true\"provisioner:kubernetes.io/aws-ebsvolumeBindingMode:Immediateparameters:fsType:ext4type:gp2to this:\napiVersion:storage.k8s.io/v1kind:StorageClassmetadata:name:gp2annotations:storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class:\"true\"provisioner:kubernetes.io/aws-ebsvolumeBindingMode:WaitForFirstConsumerparameters:fsType:ext4type:gp2The run the following commands (assuming the file above is called storageclass.yaml):\nkubectl delete sc --all kubectl apply -f storageclass.yaml This stops pods trying to bind to volumes in different AZ’s.\nYou can read more about this here:\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-cluster-multi-zone-auto-scaling-groups/\nRelevant section: If you need to run a single ASG spanning multiple AZs and still need to use EBS volumes you may want to change the default VolumeBindingMode to WaitForFirstConsumer as described in the documentation here. Changing this setting “will delay the binding and provisioning of a PersistentVolume until a pod using the PersistentVolumeClaim is created.” This will allow a PVC to be created in the same AZ as a pod that consumes it.\nIf a pod is descheduled, deleted and recreated, or an instance where the pod was running is terminated then WaitForFirstConsumer won’t help because it only applies to the first pod that consumes a volume. When a pod reuses an existing EBS volume there is still a chance that the pod will be scheduled in an AZ where the EBS volume doesn’t exist.\nYou can refer to AWS documentation for how to install the EKS Cluster-autoscaler:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-autoscaler.html\nThis is specific for your deployment IAM roles, clusternames etc, so will not specified here.\n\nConfigure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Add the following lines into your values file under the xnat-web section:\nautoscaling:enabled:trueminReplicas:2maxReplicas:100targetCPUUtilizationPercentage:80targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage:80Tailor it your own environment. this will create 2 replicas (pods) at start up, up to a limit of 100 replicas, and will scale up pods when 80% CPU and 80% Memory are utilised - read more about that again here:\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/\nThis is the relevant parts of my environment when running the get command:\nk -nxnat get horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/xnat-xnat-web NAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE xnat-xnat-web StatefulSet/xnat-xnat-web 34%/80%, 0%/80% 2 100 2 3h29m As you can see 34% of memory is used and 0% CPU.

We need to make a small change to the storageClass configuration for the ReadWriteOnce volumes and create new external volumes for the ReadWriteMany ones.\nFirstly, we create our own Azure files volumes for archive and prearchive and make a slight adjustment to the values configuration and apply as an override.\nFollow this document for the details of how to do that:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-files-volume\nFirstly, export some values that will be used to create the Azure files volumes.

The Australian Imaging Service will transform the imaging and radiology sector by leveraging institutional investments and providing enhanced data management and analysis. The distributed federation will consist of multiple institutional deployments linked with a federated search layer, common community practice, support for expanded data types and a Trusted Tool Repository ensuring ongoing ownership and accountability of data.
